            He is a musical genius. He created a lane for people to be more emotional in their music.
            He is truly irreplaceable. Hopefully he does not die anytime soon.

        <h3>The Best Kanye West Song</h3>

        <p>
            I Wonder is my favorite Kanye West Song. 
            It is simply about chasing your dreams.
            Do not wonder about would happen if you did it just do it and understand the cost of it to dream.
            Get lost in the dream of being a kid and do not let the reality of being an adult stop that
            child-like wonder you've always had.
        </p>
